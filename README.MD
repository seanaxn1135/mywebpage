-PROJECT SUMMARY-
This project is planned to be a personal webpage that I can use to share anything, be it about myself, personal thoughts, projects, achievements, and other things.

-GENERAL EXPERIENCE-
My experience on this project is generally good. This project is something I wanted to start on for quite a long time, but has not gone about doing.

I have never done web design, thus is unsure what would look good or bad. But all in all, I am generally quite happy with what came out.

Initially had a lot of design ideas I wanted to try. Many of which failed as I do not have enough technical knowledge and skills. Half of the time was spent Googling for solutions to these ideas. Some were basic and easy to understand. However, due to my lack of knowledge on Javascript, many of these designs were unable to be implemented.

Had a lot of minor design issues when creating the webpages such as alignment issues, padding issues, responsiveness issues.

Despite all the troubles and bugs, I had fun creating the webpages and would look forward to working on them whenever I had the time.




-WHAT IS CONTAINED IN EACH FILE-
    mywebpage.html:
        Contains the html code for the homepage.
    
    mywebpage.css:
        Stylesheet that contains the styling for all html files in the project.
    
    downloads.html:
        Contains the html code for the downloads page.
    
    blog.html:
        Contains the html code for the blog page.
    
    Images:
        Contains all the images used in this project. Mainly icons.



-INITIAL CONTENT IDEAS-
Initailly, content that I planned for the webpage are:
    -About me:
        basic summary to let people know about myself
    -Projects (Coding and apps):
        projects I have done to let people know what I do
    -Blog:
        can post content that I want to share with others
    -Contacts:
        let people know how to contact me
    -Downloads:
        easy access to downloadable content



-CONTENT PITFALLS-
    -Projects:
        personally felt that I didn't have any outstanding projects to post, might include in the future.
    -Blog:
        no content to post.
        (discussed later in design pitfalls)
    -Downloads:
        did not have anything for downloads besides my personal resume



-INITIAL DESIGN IDEAS-
    -Welcome:
        -Wanted to add animation to the welcome page, wanted to copy:
        https://www.wokine.com/
        Did not know how to shift background horizontally when scrolling.
    
        -Wanted to add slide animation for HELLO, to slide to either left or right and let additional information about the website fade in on the other side.

    -About me:
        -Wanted "about-me" section to be a vertical tab-styled section.
        Basic tutorials only taught about horizontal tabs and those that had vertical tabs needed javascript. (never learned javascript D:)

    -Blog:
        -Wanted each blog post to be a new html webpage with a common style (ease of adding posts).
        Something like worldpress where you have a summary of each blog post and you can click into it to see the full content on another page,
        Automated process (summrising and posting) Unsure of what is the easiest method to implement this.
        -Wanted to have a video as background, couldn't do it with youtube (need own MP4 file)

    -Contacts:
        -Wanted a vertical bar with horizontal collapsable icons. (A vertical bar, when hovered over an icon will collapse information to the right)



-TO BE FIXED-
    -About me:
        -Make content responsive
        -Content eats into Contacts section when minimised

    -Projects:
        -To be added when I have some projects.
    
    -Blog:
        -Start to add content
        -When video is fullscreen, the corners are still rounded.
