                            <h3>Sean Ang</h3>
                            <p>I am a 2nd year undergrad currently studying Computing and Information Systems at the Singapore Institute of Management.</p>
                            <p>Before university, I studied in River Valley High School and served the army for 2 years (like any other Singaporean men).</p>
                            <p>As can be seen from what I study, I'm keen in programming, problem solving and critical thinking.
                                More than that, I also like to experience and try new things, meet and interact with new people (find me in the contact me page!).</p>
                            <p>You can learn more about me in my resume, located in the <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a> or you also could <a href="#contacts-section">contact me!</a></p>

                        <h4>Coding   <img class="circular-icons" src="images/code.png"></h4>
                        <p>I learn Java in school, but I have also learned a little Python, Octave and HTML/CSS in my free time.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy doing coding practices in my free time such as <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/">leet code</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/">codewars</a>.</p>
                        <p>Aside from coding questions, I haven't really created any projects (well at least none that I'm proud enough to put out!) and would like to start developing some soon!</p>
                        <p>I'm personally quite interested in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and would like to learn more about it.</p>

                            <h4>Gaming  <img class="circular-icons" src="images/game.jpg"></h4>
                            <p>I am a big fan of gaming and play many games during my free time.</p>
                            <p>Games that I've been recently playing are Dota2 and Final Fantasy 14.</p>
                            <p>I do play single player games as well. I usually play games for the competetive and storytelling aspects</p>
                            <p>If you want to play with me or have any fun games to introduce, you can find me on steam or discord down at the <a href="#contacts-section">contact me</a> section!</p>

                            <h4>Others</h4>
                            <p>During my free time, I do many other things such as sports, piano and gym</p>
                            <p>I like to play all kinds of sports, and if possible, would like to learn more!
                                But sports that I usually play are Tennis, Badminton, and occationally Basketball</p>
                            <p>I've learned piano since I was young but have stopped playing for quite long. I've recently picked it up again.
                                If you are interested in what I am currently learning, you can visit my <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> page!
                            </p>
                            <p>I've also been wanting to learn the guitar for sometime, but have no time (or is lazy) to learn.</p>
                            <p>I also go to the gym during my free time. Fitness is pretty important when the nature of my study involves sitting infront of the computer for long hours.</p>
